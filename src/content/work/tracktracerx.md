During a 7-month engagement at TrackTraceRX, I worked on modernizing cloud environments (AWS, Oracle Cloud, Rackspace) with Infrastructure-as-Code practices using Terraform and Ansible. I containerized monolithic environments into Docker and Kubernetes, revamped CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, and implemented advanced monitoring systems, resulting in significant cost savings and improved system reliability.
