During a five-month engagement at Paylivre, I implemented Infrastructure-as-Code practices, automated operations, and redesigned critical infrastructure components to lower costs while maintaining reliability. Enhanced CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and alert systems, completing the project ahead of schedule and achieving long-term cost savings.
